                <h3>How Fidya & Kaffarah Works</h3>
                <p>
                    Fidya and Kaffarah are religious obligations for those
                    unable to fast during Ramadan due to illness, pregnancy, or
                    other reasons. Our appeal allows individuals to fulfill
                    these obligations through monetary contributions, providing
                    relief and atonement for their non-fasting days.
                </p>

                <h3>Ways to Contribute</h3>
                <p>
                    You can contribute to our Fidya & Kaffarah Appeal by making
                    a donation to cover the Fidya and Kaffarah payments on
                    behalf of individuals in need. Your support ensures that
                    they can fulfill their religious obligations and observe
                    Ramadan with peace of mind, knowing that their duties are
                    being taken care of. Together, we can support believers in
                    need and help them fulfill their religious obligations with
                    ease.
